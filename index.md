Hello! My name is *Yanzhao Wu*. With a wide range of interests, primarily lying on the fields of *Systems* and *AI*, including their intersections,
I participated in several reseach projects, mainly on distributed systems, parallel computing, automatic verfication and bioinformatics.([more information](/projects)) Research is one of my favors and I always have a strong curiosity to explore the unknown, where I think abundant experiences in various fields will inspire ingenious ideas.

### Extracurricular activities

- Sports: Running and Ping-pong. One of my most honorable events is that I finished the half-marathon in 2015 Hefei International Marathon Competition.
- Literature: I love reading novels and even try to write one.
