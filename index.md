Hello! My name is *Yanzhao Wu*. I'm now a senior undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science at
[University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)](http://en.ustc.edu.cn). With a wide range of interests, primarily lying on the fields of *Systems* and *AI*, including their intersections,
I participated in several reseach projects, mainly on distributed systems, parallel computing, automatic verfication and bioinformatics.([more information](/projects)) Research is one of my favors and I always have a strong curiosity to explore the unknown, where I think abundant experiences in various fields will inspire ingenious ideas.

### Current work

Currently, I work as a research intern in [Microsoft Research Asia (MSRA)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-asia/) in [Internet Media (IM) Group](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/internet-media/).

### Free time activities

- Sports: Running and Ping-pang. One of my most honorable events is that I finished the half-marathon in 2015 Hefei International Marathon Competition.
