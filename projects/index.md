- Code Clone Detection — An efficient and accurate code clone detection tool will be relesead soon.
- *LTS(****L****abeled* ***T****ransition* ***S****ystems)* and *Game* Model Checkers for PRISM — Primarily several logic algorithms are implemented in PRISM. And this project is maintained with *Subversion*.
- *WRF* Optimization — [*The* ***W****eathe* ***R****esearch and* ***F****orecasting(WRF)*](http://www.wrf-model.org/)  is a next-generation mesoscale numerical weather prediction system designed for both atmospheric research and operational forecasting needs. Several strategies are applied in compiling and load balance to achieve a better performance.
- *Gromacs* Optimization — [Gromacs](http://www.gromacs.org/) is a versatile package to perform molecular dynamics. Main optimization strategies include SIMD, GPU acceleration and *InfiniBand*.
- *Baymini* Robot — *Baymini* is a desktop entertainment robot able to play *Go* with people interactively.
- Port *Inferno* to *ARM* Development Boards — [*Inferno OS*](http://www.vitanuova.com/inferno/) was ported to a *Raspberry Pi* board and a *Samsung S3C6410X* development board.
- Parallel Graph Search — A new alogrithm of parallel BFS with the application of *Synchronous Queue* is well designed.
- C1 Compiler — C1 is a subset of C and its compiler is based on [LLVM](http://llvm.org/).
- A Small Web Search Engine — [*NLPLIR*(in Chinese)](http://ictclas.nlpir.org/) and [*Lucene*](http://lucene.apache.org/) are primarily used to implement this small web search engine.
- Genomics Advisor — It is an online *APP* to analyze the risk of diabetes and related diseases developed in [BCL lab(Harvard University)](http://projects.iq.harvard.edu/bcl).
- A Small MIPS CPU (16bit) — This small CPU is implemented in *Verilog* and supports over 16 instructions and debugging.
