Education
=========
[**University of Science and Technology of China**](http://en.ustc.edu.cn/)  
*School of Computer Science and Technology (Elite Class)*  
Undergraduate, 2013-2017(Expected)  
GPA Major: 3.87/4.30  
GPA Overall: 3.80/4.30  

[**University of Birmingham**](http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/)  
*School of Computer Science*  
Visiting Research Student, 2016 Summer  

Research
========
- Summer Research Internship on Automatic Verification  
[University of Birmingham](http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/)  
07/2016 — 08/2016  
[PRISM](http://www.prismmodelchecker.org/) is a probabilistic model checker, a tool for formal modeling and analysis of systems that exhibit random or probabilistic behavior.  
My main job is to implement *LTS*(***L****abeled* ***T****ransition* ***S****ystems)* model checker and *game* model checker for PRISM which will enable it to support **non-probabilistic** models further.

- Code Clone Detection  
[National High-Performance Computing Center (Hefei)](http://en.nhpcc.ustc.edu.cn/)  
09/2015 — 08/2016  
Code clone is a sequence of source of codes that occurs more than once, which is prone to introducing errors. This project aims at implementing an automated tool to find clones in source code(a.k.a. clone detection) with more efficiency and accuracy, where an approach derived from bioinformatics is elaborately applied. A **paper** on this project is expected to be published soon.  
My main job in this project is to implement the **parser**, involve in the design of the **algorithm** and prove a **theorem** related to edit distance.

- Optimization for Distributed Application  
[Advanced Computer System Architecture Laboratory](http://en.nhpcc.ustc.edu.cn/)  
09/2015 — 06/2016  
*Gromacs* and *WRF* are both classical scientific software. My main job is to optimize them on a cluster with 10 nodes for better performance. Several optimization strategies are deeply explored, such as compiling, load balance and accelerators.

- Research Program for Undergraduate On Parallel Graph Search  
[National High-Performance Computing Center (Hefei)](http://en.nhpcc.ustc.edu.cn/)  
07/2015 — 10/2015
Focusing on parallel graph search problems.  
Synchronous Queue, an efficient parallel data structure, is applied to *Bread-First Search* in order to reduce the concurrent access violation. As a result, a **new algorithm** of parallel BFS is designed and achieves good performance with fine scalability.  

- Poring Operating System to an Embedded Development Board  
Embedded System Laboratory  
03/2015 — 07/2015  
Porting [*Inferno*](http://www.vitanuova.com/inferno/), an open-source distributed operating system to an embedded board with other 3 teammates, I accumulated abundant experience in writing **driver codes** as well as certain **leading skills**.

Competition
===========
- Student Cluster Competition(SCC) 2016  
[International Supercomputing Conference(ISC)](http://www.isc-hpc.com/),  Frankfurt, Germany  
06/2016  
[ISC-SCC](http://www.isc-hpc.com/student-cluster-competition.html) is a friendly yet spirited competition for students, aiming at competing to demonstrate the incredible capabilities of state-of- the-art high-performance cluster hardware and software. We designed a cluster of 8 nodes based on *Huawei FusionServer X6800* as our competition system.  
My main job is to optimize *WRF* on our system and in charge of one secret application. Finally, we ranked **1st** on WRF benchmark due to strategies primarily applied in compiling and load balance.
